   12. Would you like user accounts to be in control of the company? (E)

We choose:
**Define Saturate and Group**

Because:
**The Design Thinking tool that we are going to use is "Define Saturate and Group" since our platform will try to provide solutions to doubts that the users have on any topic or topics and this solution will be given thanks to the expirience of other people who know about the theme or have notion of how to mend or solve a problem. The topics or topics will have to be grouped by types of needs that have to be able to have a more selective approach in terms of answers.**

Trello:

## ***Jaramillo Regino Hector Armando***
In this activity we made an improvement to what was our diagram of the last activity, only we implemented some improvements based on the interview carried out in class, it was also interesting to work with design thinking and it was easy to choose the right one for our project, in general It was a very enriching experience which allowed me to experience what an interview is like in the work environment.
